# Brooks Viewer

Made with Tauri, Create React App. Database hosted on MongoDB.

# Brooks Scraper

Uses [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) to scrape brookspriceaction.com. Puppeteer is needed because content can only be accessed by a user that is signed in.

Will be interested to see what it's like memory-wise before and after the puppeteer browser is closed.

For that test I'll need to display when I'm opening and closing the browser.
I'll just spin it up and load a few pages and then close it.
